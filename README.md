# VCSim
Virtual crowd simulation in unity

## Goal of the simulation:
Scenario for a collision:
Single robot no guidance moving in a straight line
one robot and human on a head on collision-course

Simulate a macro navigation (set a set path through atlas hotspots and see if and how a collision occurs)
We ommit hebaviour of the robot.
The goal for now is to switch to physics based movement of the robot.
If we have time, we can implement simple reduction behaviour

# Presentation
Problem: Blind person navigating in Atlas (Unfamiliar enviroment) (Motivate by emails to Real Estate) when it's busy  
Analysis: Aspect to consider [e.g. crowds]
Solution: Show how the robot solves the problem  

A robot that uses a more human like aproach to navigation (in crowded spaces), pushing. This is an innovative approach to navigation which helps with this guidance problem. Clearly define the scobe of the robot's capabilities.

Show past state of the art. Mention how the hazards have desuaded previous authors. Our first step was thus to make the robot safe.

This resulted in our physical design. To verify safety of the design a simulation was made. A macro simulation helps scoping out hazardous scenario's but it became clear how insufficient our behaviour model was. We decided to create a more controlled scenario to confirm the safety. This can be seen [in the collision impact]. This simulation takes into account response from the robot and the pedestrians.



Have a focus on the user aspect of crowd navigation.
